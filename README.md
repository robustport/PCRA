The paper "Robust Statistics for Portfolio Construction and Analysis" by 
R. Douglas Martin, Stoyan V. Stoyanov, Kirk Li and Mahmoud Shammaa, published
in 2023 by *The Journal of Portfolio Management*, 49  ( 9) 105 - 139.  See the
 [Paper Abstract](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijpormgmt/49/9/105),
where JPM Subscribers can also download the paper.

The R script file `RobustStatisticsForPortfoliosJPM2023.R` for reproducing most
of the Figures and Tables in the above paper is available in the PCRA package at 
`PCRA/demo`.  Download that R script by going to `PCRA/demo` and double clicking 
on the file, which then allows you to either click on the "Download raw file" 
link or the "Copy raw file" link.  If you have RStudio installed, the first choice 
may open the file in RStudio.  Otherwise you can paste the file into an empty R
script.

If you have any problems with the code, please send emails to both Doug Martin at 
`martinrd3d@gmail.com` and Kirk Li at `cocokecoli@gmail.com`. 
We will post responses in this README file.

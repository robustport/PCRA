A data frame with monthly time series of returns, Weighted Average 
Maturity (WAM), Modified Duration (Dmod), Yield to Maturity (YTM) and 
Option Adjusted Spread (OAS) from January 1988 to December 2021 for two 
short duration indices maintained by ICE Data Indices, LLC
1. ICE BofA 1-3 Year AAA-A US Corporate Index (Index C110), and
2. ICE BofA 1-3 Year US Treasury Index (Index G1O2) 
Returns are total returns (i.e. coupon income + price change divided by 
initial price) for the month, and are expressed in percentage points 
(e.g. 2.05 corresponds to a total return of 2.05% for the month). 
WAM and Dmod are expressed in years and are reported as of month end. 
YTM, like total return, is reported in percentage points 
(e.g. 5.05 corresponds to a Yield to Maturity of 5.05%), while OAS is expressed 
in basis points or 1/100th of 1% (e.g. 8 corresponds to an Option Adjusted 
Spread of 8 basis points or 0.08%). All items other than returns are reported 
as of month-end. Returns are reported in every month, but not all characteristics 
are reported at the end of every month.

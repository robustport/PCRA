\description{
Monitor the Logarithmic Information Ratio of a portfolio relative to its benchmark 
and raise an alarm when sufficient evidence accrues to indicate that its current LIR is <0
using an optimal changepoint detection scheme (the CUSUM algorithm)
An object of class \code{"tsfm"} is returned.
}
\details{
Assessing the performance of active managers is hard because active returns are noisy. 
In addition, their risk must be taken into account, and this is commonly measured by the 
standard deviation of active returns. Empirical studies of active managers across a wide range 
of asset classes suggest that an Annualized Logarithmic Information Ratio 
(LIR = Active Log Return / Std. Dev.(Active Log Return)) of 0.5 over a period of 5 years or more 
is exceptional, as markets are very efficient. The majority of active managers deliver active
returns and IR close to 0, and even those with a positive IR are at constant risk of having their
added value dissipate. Investors, therefore, must continually estimate the current performance of
their active portfolios and determine when sufficient evidence has accrued to suggest that their
active return and IR have fallen to 0. Put differently, investors need to rapidly detect changes,
particularly negative changes, in the performance of their portfolios. 

There is a rich literature on changepoint detection, and of the many available algorithms,
the CUSUM (an acronym for CUmulative SUM) stands out, on account of its simplicity, 
its robustness to the actual distribution of active returns, and the optimal trade-off 
between detection time and the rate of false alarms that it offers. 
It is closely retlated to Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) but is much simpler 
to implement, and requires minimal inputs from the user. In this application, it seeks to 
determine when the IR of a portfolio has changed from a good level (default = 0.5 )
to a bad level (default = 0). An alarm is raised when the CUSUM scheme crosses a threshold, 
which is chosen to make the average time between false alarms 84 months (7 years). 
By way of comparison, the time taken to detect a transition from good performance to bad is 
41 months (or 3 1/2 years). This is much faster than the traditional t-test, which would take 
16 years to obtain a t-statistic of 2. The threshold can be recalibrated to meet a user's needs.

Description: A collection of functions and data sets to support teaching a
  quantitative finance MS level course on Robust Portfolio Construction and Risk
  Analysis.  The package is unique in providing functions for both classical and
  modern analytic methods.  The latter includes robust regression and robust
  covariance matrix estimation methods that are not much influenced by outliers,
  minimum downside risk portfolio construction, and computation of accurate
  standard errors for risk and performance estimators with non-normal and
  serially dependent returns.  The data sets include cross-sections of stock
  data from the Center for Research on Security Prices, LLC (CRSP), and factor
  exposures for those stocks from S&P Global.

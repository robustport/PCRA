Description: A collection of functions and data sets that support teaching
  a quantitative finance MS level course on Portfolio Construction and Risk
  Analysis, and the writing of a textbook for such a course.  The package is
  unique in providing several real-world data sets that may be used for problem
  assignments and student projects.  The data sets include cross-sections of
  stock data from the Center for Research on Security Prices, LLC (CRSP),
  corresponding factor exposures data from S&P Global, and several SP500 data
  sets.
